# SVM-Classification

Support Vector Machine is a geometric method used for classification problems for machine learning. Importance of geometric methods is seen on dataset with small data. Here we show how svm will help to solve classification problems with limited data . We also see dierent kernels used in SVM . Here we use heart disease dataset from UCI datasets.
